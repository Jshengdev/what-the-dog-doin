"""The proximity field: an entity with a radius walks the path drawn on ui/map.json and every light's brightness is how
much of it sits inside that radius, weighted toward the centre. One implementation, used by the chat's wake demo
(tools.call("walk_path")) and by the remote's walk button (POST /tools/walk_path); the page only animates the dot.

  python -m wtdd walk_path dry=true        compute and log every level, write nothing (writes = 0 in the row)
  python -m wtdd walk_path                 drive the real lights
  lamp:   score = (1 - d/R) ** falloff at the lamp's point
  strip:  the mean of that over `samples` points along its line (a graze at the edge is dim, a pass over the middle bright)
  rooms:  score *= other_room_factor when the light's room (the polygon its point sits in) is not the entity's room
Map keys read: path (at least 2 points), stops [path indices], entity {radius_px 220, speed_px_s 60, falloff 1.6,
other_room_factor 0.3, samples 12, min_step 4, floor 6}, lights [{id, label, kind dot|line, pts, device hue|strip}],
rooms [{name, poly}].
lights[].room is recomputed here from the polygons, whatever the file says.
Writes go through the registry (hue_light_set per lamp, strip_set for the strip): one thread per light and at most one
write in flight per light, so each light steps exactly as fast as its own measured latency allows (the strip about 0.4 s
on the LAN, a Hue lamp through the cloud about 0.8 s), only when the level moved by at least `min_step` points or
crossed zero, and is simply off below `floor`. The loop polls at HZ. Order: every light to 0 and wait for all of it (the
room starts dark and the first latency of each light is measured), the walk in real time at speed_px_s, then every
light to 0 again and wait. One field.walk ledger row with seconds, writes, errors, rooms crossed and the mean latency per
light; every write is its own row, a failed write is counted and logged, never retried. While it runs, <repo>/field.json
holds the entity's position, room, levels and current stop (atomic writes at HZ, removed at the end); the API serves it
at GET /field and the remote draws the dot from it, whichever process runs the walk; a field.json younger than BUSY_S
means a walk is live and a second walk (the button during a chat round, or the reverse) is refused, never interleaved. Stops: map.json `stops` is a list
of path point indices (double-click a path point on the remote); at each one the walk pauses and calls on_stop(index,
point, room), the lights hold, then it resumes. The chat's wake sequence passes its look-and-say as on_stop; with no
stops on the map it looks once at the end of the path. source="dog" (WTDD_ROUND=dog in the chat): the entity is the
real dog's calibrated odometry pose from the API, the follower (POST /dog/follow) drives it and pauses at the stops,
and the walk ends when the follower ends; a failed follow raises with the lights' numbers in the message. Measured on the live wake demo
(2026-09-13): dark start 1.46 s, walk 63.6 s across four rooms (seven crossings, five lights), 67 writes, 0 errors.
