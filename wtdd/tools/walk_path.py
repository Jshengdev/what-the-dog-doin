"""Walk the route and drive the real lights by the field (closer = brighter, the strip scored along its length, other
rooms dimmed), pausing at the map's stops. source=entity: a simulated entity walks the drawn path in real time (the dog
is hand-driven). source=dog: the API's follower drives the real dog along the same path (calibrated, avoidance on), the
lights follow where it believes it is, and at every stop the dog performs the action recorded there (map.json
`actions`: the look kind and whether to post; default a tilt look posted to the castle), keyed round:<epoch>:<stop> so a
replay never posts twice for one stop. The chat's wake sequence calls wtdd.field.walk itself to key the posts on the
wake message. Returns seconds, writes, rooms, stops, and the actions done."""
